A few thoughts regarding my month-long [jaunt on a

#### The Noise

One of the things I miss the most is the drone of my small 250cc single-piston
engine. It doesn't roar; it purrs angrily. The knobby tires kick up gravel,
which pings loudly across the engine guard. There's wind, hot and dry, chapping
my lips and whistling through that part of my helmet I could never get to seal
correctly.

I was supposed to wear earplugs to protect my ears. I never did.

In early June, I camped next to a stream in Sawtooth National Forest. It was
running high due to snowmelt, rushing along full of fish and bugs and whatever
else got caught up. It was cold. Really cold. The white noise it generated was
enough to drown out the crickets; no small feat. After a while, it became part
of the calm of the place. The noise became a part of the experience. It wouldn't
be the same place without it.

#### Family

The route for this trip is dotted with cities where my family lives.

At first, I was reluctant to stay with family. I'm not sure exactly why. I had
some notion that it might ruin the "adventure" of the thing. Which is silly, in
retrospect. No adventure is so grand it must be experienced alone. Some of the
best moments on this trip happened when I was with family. Eating pie for lunch
at a diner next to an airfield, or checking out the city fair, or just having a
beer at a new brewery after a day at the range.  It doesn't matter what, but
who. Family made this trip great.

#### "Nothing I can do about it now."

I've never been much of a worrier, but I found myself constantly worried out on
the road. Maybe it was the endless hours alone, or the adrenline of the
experience, or my brain looking for a new distraction. Most of the time it was
something small, like a change in the vibration of the bike. Sometimes it was a bigger
concern, like a gas light. Either way, worry gnaws at you, growing in your brain
until it's all you're thinking about.

Eventually, enough was enough. "Nothing I can do about it now" became my mantra.
I had gear go missing, bolts get vibrated loose, batteries die, tires go bald,
and the gas light shining constantly. And it was okay, because there was nothing I
could do about it.

It's nice letting go.

#### Broken

Before wrecking the bike in Bend, I'd never had a broken bone before. It's was
an interesting experience. From breaking it through surgery until now, I haven't
experienced any real pain. It's been uncomfortable, sure, but never sharp or
acute _pain_. Which is okay with me.

The wreck itself was sudden, loud, awful. Riding per usual, then losing control
over a hill, getting thrown off, and feeling the bike tumble over the top of me.
I laid on the ground for a while wondering what had happened, then I started
yelling. Not because I was in pain, but because I was in shock and it seemed
like the right thing to do. I frequently reflect on that moment; I felt
compelled to scream, like it was the only thing that would save right then.

I even remember thinking to myself, "why are you yelling?" I'm still not sure
why.  Maybe next time I'll play it cool.

#### The End

I'm disappointed I didn't get to finish my trip. It's a "first world"
disappointment, a temporary setback. But, really, the month I was out was an
irreplaceable experience; if I had to break my collar bone to do it again, I'd
do it again. So, when the time is right, I'll set out for Alaska to finish. I
might not even make it down the street, but there's nothing I can do about that
now.
