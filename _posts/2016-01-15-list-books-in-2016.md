**Notes**

- Jun 29 2016<br />
  <small>A motorcycle trip starting in mid-May took up most of my reading time.
  I was able to finish a couple of books; hopefully, my normal reading schedule
  can resume now.</small>

- Mar 7 2016<br />
  <small>Taking on some heavy reading for the next few books.</small>

- Jan 15 2016<br />
  <small>I've added quite a few new ones in the last week, trying to force
  myself to read a little every day. We'll see if it works. I'm also
  considering a switch to physical copies (vs a Kindle); I like the idea of
  marking up books, but I'm not sure I like it enough to have a bunch of books
  lying around.</small>

- Feb 18 2016<br />
  <small>My pace has slowed somewhat. *Lois on the Loose* and *The Pursuit of
  God* are short, but *Business Adventures* is long-ish. Almost done with it.
  I'd like to do a biography next.</small>
