title: 'Notes: The 2015 Dell XPS 13, Linux'

I recently purchased a 2015 Dell XPS 13. The new laptop replaces my
four-year-old Lenovo x220.

Just some quick thoughts on the upgrade:

- This screen is *fantastic*. It's the 1080p, matte FHD. Initially I
  was going to go with the "4k" but HiDPI isn't there yet (on any
  platform) and, mainly, glossy screens are silly.

- The keyboard is good, not great. After four years of using the
  **best** laptop keyboard ever produced (I will fight you) it's hard to
  see other keyboards as "great." In any case, there's a known key
  bounce problem that occasionally causes repeated keystrokes. Ubuntu
  (Unity, actually) includes de-bouncing software so it hasn't been
  noticable.

- Speaking of problems, the trackpad driver for Linux doesn't support
  palm detection just yet. This *has* been noticeable because it's
  incredibly annoying when your cursor jumps across the screen while
  you're typing.
 
- Ubuntu 15.04 works out of the box, sans the above input problems.

- The speakers are great. Quite loud and they resonate through the
  laptop in a way that makes them feel larger than they are.

- The headphone jack is *really* tight. I thought it was one of those
  old BlackBerry-style 2.5mm adapters at first. 3.5mm fits...if you push
  hard enough.

- It's not a great idea to judge battery life on one day of usage but
  I won't be surprised if this gets 10 or 11 hours on a charge.

- No kidding, this screen is fantastic.
